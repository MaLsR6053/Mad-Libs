# Python-Projects
This is a place for my python projects as I learn more about scripting and programming.

<h2>MadLibs:</h2>

  - [The Great Adventure](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Mad-Libs/blob/main/The%20Great%20Adventure.py)

<h2>Black Hat Python</h2>

  - [TCP Client](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/Python%20TCP%20Client.py)
  - [UDP Client](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/Python%20UDP%20Client.py)
  - [SQLi Password Brute Force](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/sqli_lab_password_brute.py) - Original credit goes to: [rkhal101](https://github.com/rkhal101/Web-Security-Academy-Series/blob/main/sql-injection/lab-11/sqli-lab-11.py). I simply made the script a bit more user-friendly, however the base functionality of the script remains unchanged.
