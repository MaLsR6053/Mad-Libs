# Python-Projects
This is a place for my python projects as I learn more about scripting and programming.


  - [TCP Client](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/Python%20TCP%20Client.py) - 
  - [UDP Client Script](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/Python%20UDP%20Client.py) | [UDP Client README](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/UPD%20Client%20README.md))(https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/UPD%20Client%20README.md)) - This script demonstrates how to create a simple UDP client using Python's socket module. It sends a small message to a specified target host and port, then listens for and prints the response.
    
  - [SQLi Password Brute Force](https://github.com/MaLsR6053/Python-Projects/blob/main/sqli_lab_password_brute.py) - Original credit goes to: [rkhal101](https://github.com/rkhal101/Web-Security-Academy-Series/blob/main/sql-injection/lab-11/sqli-lab-11.py). I simply made the script a bit more user-friendly, however the base functionality of the script remains unchanged.
